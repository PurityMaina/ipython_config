Keep Getting this Error in your iPython?

ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.

No problemo!!Easy Peasy
You just need to import django's settings,(ipython is in python not django) then configure the settings,cd to the scripts' foolder,then type in the following commands;

- from django.conf import settings
- settings.configure()
